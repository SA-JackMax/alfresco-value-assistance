It starts at 19:00 minutes

This project was first described here http://blog.tsgrp.com/2013/07/10/alfresco-data-list-driven-value-assistance/
It was when I got the source code and changed it to Alfresco SDK project format.

This project tries to reimplement (at least part of) the functionalities shown on this post http://blog.tsgrp.com/2014/12/17/harnessing-the-power-of-alfresco-data-lists-for-cascading-value-assistance/

At the moment, only 2 level dependency is working.
